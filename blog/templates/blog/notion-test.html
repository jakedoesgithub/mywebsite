            Kleiman, and chefs Ray Garcia, Bricia Lopez, and Carlos Salgado have spent more than a lifetime
            preparing, eating, and writing about Latin American cuisine. Before their recent <a href="http://www.getty.edu/visit/cal/events/ev_2035.html">panel discussion</a> at the Getty,
            offered
            in conjunction with Pacific Standard Time, they sat down with us to reflect on the role of Mexican
            cuisine in the life of Los Angeles and how we might expand our taste buds to go deeper.

                    my approach is much more trial and error. It’s part social scientist, and part repair person
                    or
                    builder. I put food out, and wait for the reaction, and see what we can push, what we can

            <strong>JG:</strong> I’m a writer. Some people can
            call writers artists, some people cannot. In terms of food, there are people who approach cuisine
            from
            an art angle. Carlos Salgado is astonishing that way. His food is rooted in Mexican flavors, but
            there’s
            this level of abstraction in his food. Is it art as opposed to food? No, it’s food, but it’s being
            approached in a different way.

            <strong>CS:</strong> The highest point in my life
            is
            being with close family and friends, in the backyard over a fire, cooking over the course of many
            hours,
            sitting under the sky, and just filling this space with so much warmth. When I’m cooking there, I
            feel
            much more like an artist than when I worked in the highest-concept restaurants. They are like
            museums of
            food, accessible only with a certain level of literacy on the part of the diner, with a certain
            level of
            cultural experience and background.

                    tender. They’re wrapped in banana leaves, so there’s a different flavor. And the way they

                    filled is different; often there’s olives or raisins or prunes in them.

            <strong>RG:</strong> Put aside your thoughts and
            limitations on what Mexican food can be, and how much it can cost. Especially in LA, there is almost
            a
            cult-like following for cheap Mexican food, for the greasy taco truck. There is something people
            find
            exciting about that, but I think it’s good to stop and wonder why your taco costs a dollar. There
            must
            be a lot behind it that allows you to eat a dollar taco. It probably doesn’t include a living wage,
            a
            safe work environment, or the best quality ingredients for you and your body. We could understand
            where
            our food is coming from and be a bit more conscious in our choices.
