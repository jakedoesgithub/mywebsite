    <h1>The Best VSCode Extensions for Python Developers in 2024</h1>

    <p>
        Anyone who uses VSCode is likely aware of the value of extensions. For those using VSCode to write Python code, they are pretty much essential for even basic functionality. I've been using VSCode for about 5+ years now, and these are the best extensions I've found for writing Python code in VSCode.
    </p>

    <h2>Python and Pylance + Jupyter</h2>

    <p>
        These extensions by Microsoft are not only a great starting point for anyone working with Python in VSCode, I'd even go as far as to say that its essential to doing so. <b>Python</b> will enable features like Intelisense, linting, debugging, code navigation, code formatting, refactoring, variable explorer, test explorer, and more. It's an all-in-one package providing almost all of the basic functionality a Python developer needs. Then <b>Pylance</b> supercharges your Python IntelliSense experience with fast, feature-rich language support derived from Pyright to ode comprehension and accelerates writing speed with auto-completions, type information, and source documentation. <b>Jupyter</b>, on the other hand, is just for if you want to run your code in a Jupyter Notebook inside of VSCode code.
    </p>

    <h2>Python Environment Manager</h2>

    <p>
        This extension by Don Jayamanne is a must-have for anyone working with multiple Python environments. This VSCode extension allows the user the ability to manage and view all their python environments and packages from a single place, helpfully grouped by the supplier of those environments (Conda, PyEnv, etc.). It also allows you to easily switch between Python interpreters and virtual environments and to create new environments. It can also be used to easily install packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and Conda for any of your environments.
    </p>

    <h2>Python Test Explorer</h2>

         width="1200"
         height="525"

    <p>
        This extension is a game-changer for anyone who understands the critical role of testing in software development. It allows the user the ability to run and debug Python tests with Test Explorer UI. By utilizing the Test Explorer framework, the Python Test Explorer extension transforms the often mundane and confusing task of testing into a more manageable and visual experience. It supports UnitTest, Pytest, and Testplan.
    </p>
    <p>Features of Python Test Explorer:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Intuitive Test Visualization</li>
        <li>Easy Test Execution</li>
        <li>Real-Time Results and Debugging</li>
        <li>Support for Multiple Testing Frameworks</li>
        <li>Customizable Test Configurations</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Python Indent</h2>

         height="419"
         alt="">

    <p>
        Python indent ensures that the IDE handles indents correctly in Python files. Basically it will ensure that the next line afrter you hit the "enter" key will always have the proper amount of indentation. Without this you will be pretty much married to your tab key while writing Python code. It can handle multiline lists and dictionaries, "if-else"  clauses, and everything else Python throws your way. Its more a quality-of-life kind of extension than an essential one, but it will save you a ton of time and aggravation so you should for sure grab it.
    </p>

    <h2>autoDocString</h2>

         height="604"
         alt="">

    <p>
        This extension by Nils Werner automatically generate docstrings for Python functions. It supports multiple formats such as Google, Numpy, Sphynx, and other popular formats. If you use type annotations in your function definition, i will automatically add parameters and return types to the generated docstring.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to generate a docstring, you need to start a multi-line comment by typing """ on the very first line after the function definition and hit the "enter" key.
    </p>

    <p>
        Features of <b>autoDocString</b>:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li></li>
        <li>Quickly generate a docstring snippet that can be tabbed through.</li>
        <li>Choose between several different types of docstring formats.</li>
        <li>Infers parameter types through pep484 type hints, default values, and var names.</li>
        <li>Support for args, kwargs, decorators, errors, and parameter types</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Black Formatter and Flake 8</h2>

    <p>
        It's hard to illustrate what exactly Black Formatter and Flake 8 do with just a picture, so here's some cute cats instead.
    </p>

         alt="An image of cats because I didn't have a good picture for black-formatter">

    <p>
        Both Black and Flake8 are two pivotal tools that can dramatically improve your coding workflow in Python. They are essential for maintaining code quality, readablility, and consistency in all projects where Black takes care of the formatting, and Flake8 handles the linting.
    </p>

    <p>
        Black is a Python code formatter that standardizes the format of your Python code, allowing you to focus on logic rather than style. You don't even have to remember to apply it to your code, you can simply enable "Format on Save" in your VSCode prefrences and Black will automatically format the entire document you are working on whenever you hit CTRL+S. You can configure it differently if you desire, but I found that the default configuration works just fine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Flake8 is a command-line utility that checks your code base against coding style (PEP 8), programming errors, and complex or buggy constructs.
    </p>

    <p>Key features include</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Code quality checks</li>
        <li>Style guide enforcement</li>
        <li>Check McCabe complexity</li>
        <li>Plugin support</li>
    </ol>
